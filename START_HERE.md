## 💡 PRO TIPS:

1. **Keep two browser tabs open:**
   - Tab 1: Railway dashboard
   - Tab 2: Vercel dashboard

2. **Copy the environment variables carefully:**
   - One mistake = deployment fails
   - Use copy-paste from DEPLOYMENT_CREDENTIALS.md

3. **Save your URLs:**
   - Railway backend URL → needed for Vercel
   - Vercel frontend URL → needed for CORS

4. **Test the backend first:**
   - After Railway deploys, test `/docs` endpoint
   - Make sure you see 51 API endpoints
   - Then deploy frontend
