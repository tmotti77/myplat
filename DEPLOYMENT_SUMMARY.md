## 💡 Why This Solution Beats Others

### vs. Self-Hosting (Docker):
- ❌ Self-hosting: Dependency issues, manual updates, downtime
- ✅ Cloud: Zero maintenance, auto-updates, 99.9% uptime

### vs. AWS/GCP (DIY):
- ❌ AWS: Complex setup, expensive, steep learning curve
- ✅ Cloud PaaS: 30-minute setup, predictable costs, simple

### vs. Heroku (Old Standard):
- ❌ Heroku: Expensive ($25-50/dyno), slower, being deprecated
- ✅ Railway/Vercel: Cheaper ($7-15), faster, modern stack

### vs. All-in-One (Replit, etc.):
- ❌ All-in-one: Limited scalability, vendor lock-in
- ✅ Our stack: Mix & match, scale independently, portable
